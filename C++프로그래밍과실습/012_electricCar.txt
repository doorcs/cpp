설명

We are going from Busan to Seoul by electric car. 

The battery capacity of the car we ride is 72.6kWh, and the car takes 5.6 km/kWh of electric consumption per hour.

We assume that  the distance between Busan and Seoul is 420km. 

It's calculated that we can not get to Seoul in one trip without additional charging the electric car. 

So, we should make a plan to take a rest at a hightway rest area and charge up to 80% of its capacity.



문제

Plan a journey from Busan to Seoul in an electric car, focusing on efficient battery management and strategic planning of charging stops.



Available Waypoints with Charging Stations: Gyeongsan (100 km), Gimcheon (200 km), Cheongju (300 km), Anseong (400 km).



Tasks:

Calculate and output the remaining battery percentage at regular intervals (every 10% decrement).
Plan charging stops at waypoints in advance to avoid running the battery below a critical level (20%).
Determine the optimal charging stops based on the initial battery charge, battery consumption rate, and the distances to the next available charging stations.


Charging Strategy:

The car should charge at a waypoint if it is anticipated that the battery level will fall below 20% before reaching the next charging station.
The car should recharge up to a specified level (80%) at each charging stop.
The choice of charging station and the decision to stop for a charge should be based on the remaining battery level, the distance already traveled, and the distance to the next charging station.
The car should not backtrack; all movements should be forward along the route from Busan to Seoul.
